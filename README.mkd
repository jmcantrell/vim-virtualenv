virtualenv.vim
==============

When using :python or :!python, it will only have access to the environment outside of any virtualenvs. If you're working with packages that are only installed in a virtualenv, they will not be available to Vim.

*__Until now!__* The virtualenv.vim plugin will modify python's sys.path and the $PATH environment variable so that anything done with :python or :!python will behave like you would expect for the chosen virtualenv.

If compiled with python support, Vim will have a :python command, but this will be tied to whatever version is the default on your system. If this is the version of python that you use, or you're using a Linux distribution with a sensible package manager (like Debian or Ubuntu), you likely will not have to do anything more than install the plugin. If not, then you will likely have to recompile vim with your version of python.

The plugin is even smart enough to handle situations where Vim inherits an active virtualenv from the shell. The plugin can switch between and deactivate those virtualenvs all the same.

Usage examples
==============

Deactivate the current virtualenv

    :VirtualEnvDeactivate

List all virtualenvs

    :VirtualEnvList

Activate the 'spam' virtualenv

    :VirtualEnvActivate spam

If you're sure which one to activate, you could always use tab completion

    :VirtualEnvActivate <tab>

If the shell that started vim had $VIRTUAL\_ENV set, omitting the name will
imply usage of this value.

If you're a virtualenvwrapper user and have $PROJECT\_HOME set, omitting the
name will try to guess which virtualenv to activate based on the current
filename.

You can even show the current virtualenv in the statusline with the included function
